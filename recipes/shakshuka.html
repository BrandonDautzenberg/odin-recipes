        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shakshouka is a delicious combination of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce. Although it has an unusual name, the dish is straightforward and easy to make.
            Eggs are then added directly to the tomato sauce and poached until done. Merguez sausage can also be added to the dish. It is believed that shakshouka originated in Tunisia, 
            but the dish is well-known and commonly eaten throughout North Africa and the Middle East as well. 
            It is usually made in a skillet in which onions, tomatoes, and spices are cooked until they form a delicious tomato sauce.</p>
